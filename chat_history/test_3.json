This program will ask the user for their name and greet them.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream> // For input/output stream\n#include <string>   // For std::string\n\n// Function to greet the user\nvoid greet(const std::string& name) {\n    std::cout << \"Hello, \" << name << \"! Welcome to C++ programming!\" << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string userName;\n\n    // Get user's name\n    std::cout << \"Please enter your name: \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, userName); // Use std::getline to handle spaces in the name\n\n    // Greet the user\n    greet(userName);\n\n    return 0; // Indicate successful execution of the program\n}\n```\n\nTo compile and run this program, you would typically use a command like `g++` to compile it, and then execute the resulting binary:\n\n```bash\ng++ -o greet_program greet.cpp\n./greet_program\n```\n\nReplace `greet.cpp` with the name of your source file if you save the code under a different name. After running the program, it will wait for you to input your name, after which it will greet you.",
