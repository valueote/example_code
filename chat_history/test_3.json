Here's how you might do it on a terminal or command prompt:\n\n```\ngcc -o hello hello.c\n./hello\n```\n\nIn the above commands, `gcc -o hello hello.c` compiles the source code file `hello.c` into an executable named `hello`, and `./hello` runs the compiled program. Remember, this is a simple example to get you started!å–µ~",
